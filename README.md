# SignUpForm
complete signup form

This project is a complete android signup page. It asks the user to create an account by filling out basic information which are UserName, Email, and password. If the user didn't fill any of these information an error message will show up on each of the unfilled boxes

The program also has a password confirmation in which the user will have to reenter the password. If the passwords don't match an error message will appear saying that passwords don't match.
